Lepidoptera is the scientific name for the order of insects including moths and butterflies.
These bugs play an essential role as food for birds and other animals in our ecosystem.
However, Leps themselves often struggle to find food as gardeners like you continue to plant
non-native plants in their gardens. We can immensely help these insects by simply choosing
to native plants for our gardens. With help from us, we urge you to join us on our journey to
plant native!
